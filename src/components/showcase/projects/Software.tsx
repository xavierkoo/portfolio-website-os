                <p>
                    A comprehensive solution that addresses critical operational
                    inefficiencies in legal disbursement processing at Anthony Law Corporation (ALC), a law firm
                    specialising in real estate conveyancing. The existing manual workflow, which consumed
                    approximately eight hours daily, posed significant challenges in data accuracy, processing speed,
                    and resource utilisation. Through the implementation of an automated disbursement
                    management system, the team has achieved substantial improvements in operational efficiency
                    while maintaining stringent security and compliance requirements.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    The solution's technical architecture combines modern frontend technologies with robust
                    backend services, implementing three key innovations. First, an enterprise-grade on-premise
                    deployment ensures data sovereignty and security compliance. Second, an advanced OCR
                    document processing system successfully handles diverse form formats from five major banks
                    with 99% accuracy. Third, a sophisticated backup and recovery mechanism enables system
                    restoration within five minutes, ensuring business continuity.

                    OpPORTunity introduces three powerful components: Firstly, PortBOT a chatbot that I developed which 
                    acts as a seamless internal knowledge base, efficiently addressing employee queries. Its intuitive interface 
                    and robust backend architecture ensure swift and accurate responses, enhancing overall productivity. Externally, 
                    it extends its capabilities to potential candidates by providing resume reviews and suggesting potential job role 
                    matches. This unique feature enhances candidate experience and streamlines the hiring process.

                    S3, Lambda, CloudFront, Route 53, WAF, API Gateway), and React TypeScript. The solution was designed to handle thousands of

                    This project was part of the module IT Solution Architecture which required my team and I to design an authentication solution for a real-world client.
                    It was a fun experience and my first time working with AWS services. I learned a lot about the different services AWS offers
                    and how to design a system that is both scalable and secure. One of the biggest challenges was designing AWS Cognito without
                    the use of the hosted login page, which required the creation of a custom login page and authentication flow that would work
                    with Cognito.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Overall it was a success and the client was very happy with the final product. There was a funny incident
                    which led to our domain being flagged as a phishing site posing as a real bank by the Singapore Police Force the day before
                    the client presentation. We took it as a compliment that our site looked so professional that it was mistaken for a real bank's site.
                    In the end, we were able to resolve the issue rather quickly as we designed the system to be easily integrated into any client's
                    existing systems, so a simple change of the domain name and logo was all that was needed.

                    This project was done as part of my module on Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It was my first experience using Spring Boot and utilizing 
                    OOP principles to design a system. It was a great learning experience and I learned a lot about how to design a system that is both scalable and secure. 
                    One of the biggest challenges was designing the system to be easily customizable and user-friendly. We wanted to make sure that the client could easily 
                    create and edit forms and workflows. So this project was as much a design challenge as it was a coding challenge.

                <p>
                    GreenVenture is an innovative mobile application that incentivizes users to recycle non-contaminated materials by providing rewards for their efforts. Inspired by the 
                    successful Healthy 365 app from the Health Promotion Board (HPB), GreenVenture takes a similar approach, allowing users to scan a QR code to earn points for recycling. 
                    This not only motivates users to take action towards a more sustainable future but also provides instant feedback on whether their item is a valid recyclable. 
                    By making recycling a more rewarding and engaging experience, GreenVenture aims to encourage a wider community to participate in environmental efforts and make a 
                    positive impact on the planet.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    GreenVenture utilizes a scalable microservices-based architecture with React, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and 
                    Docker and integrated a messaging system using AMQP based LavinMQ message broker with nodemailer for user emails.
